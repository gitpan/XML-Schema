This directory contains the documentation for the XML::Schema modules.

The 'html' directory contains the documentation in HTML format.

The 'pod' directory contains POD files which are automatically grafted
onto the appropriate .pm modules in the '../lib' directory during 
the 'make dist' process (you generally don't need to worry about this).

The other directories contain various XML files, Template Toolkit
templates, scripts, config files, and so on, which are used to build
the HTML and POD documentation from source.  Again, this is only 
something you need to worry about if you want to make any updates 
to the documentation and rebuild it (patches welcome to the code and/or
documentation!).

If you want to rebuild the documentation then you'll need to have the 
Template Toolkit v2.04 or later installed, the XML::DOM module v1.27
or later, and possibly some other modules that I forget right now...
All you need to do is run the bin/build script and leave it to take
care of the rest.  It generates a ttree config file suitable for your
site, using the etc/ttree.tt2 template as source.  It then invokes
ttree to build the documentation using this output configuration 
file, sending the output to the 'html' directory.

Enjoy
