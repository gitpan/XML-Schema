    <p>
    The XML::Schema module set implements the necessary functionality to
    construct, represent and utilise XML Schemata in Perl.  From a 
    schema, an XML parser can be generated which is dedicated to parsing 
    and validating XML instance documents according to that schema
    specification.  In addition, the modules support a powerful 
    extension mechanism to allow custom processing actions to be
    scheduled for execution at different times during the parsing 
    of instance documents, e.g. on a particular element, type, 
    attribute, etc.  By this simple annotation of a schema with 
    Perl callbacks, it is possible to build extremely flexible, 
    powerful <i>and</i> efficient XML processing and manipulation 
    applications.
    </p>

    
    <p>
    An XML Schema is essentially a formal specification of the
    structure (i.e. elements and attributes) and the data types
    (i.e. element content and attribute values) of a particular class
    of XML document.  An XML document which conforms to a particular
    schema is then said to be a valid instance document of that
    schema.
    </p>


    <p>
    A Document Type Definition (DTD) is one example of a simple
    schema specification.  The W3C XML Schema specification is 
    another example, boasting a far richer set of features and
    the additional complexity that goes with it.  In fact there
    are currently more than a dozen different published standards
    for representing XML schemata, most of which are syntactic 
    and semantic variations of the same theme.
    </p>


    <p>
    The XML::Schema module set aims to implement a generic framework
    for parsing XML documents according to a schema definition of 
    some kind.  It is hoped that by providing the appropriate hooks
    through which different schema "backends" can be attached, we can 
    extend the basic framework to build schema representations and
    parsers compatible with many of the different schema standards.
    </p>


    <p>
    Much of the architecture is based around the W3C XML Schema
    specification and conformance with this standard in particular
    is a desired goal of the project.  The simple types supported
    by these modules are a direct implementation of the W3C XML
    Schema Datatypes (although some are currently incomplete or
    not yet implemented).  This provides a rich and powerful set
    of data types which, to the author's best knowledge, is a 
    superset of the data types supported by other schema standards.
    </p>


    <p>
    The schema structure is also based on that defined in the 
    W3C XML Schema Structures specification although some of the
    more advanced features are not yet implemented.  The modules
    implement a fairly generic set of objects for representing
    complex types, elements, attributes and content models.  These
    can be extended through subclassing by implementations 
    offering greater conformance to one or other schema standard
    that requires a more specific or different implementation.
    </p>


    <p> There is currently no support for reading a schema
    specification from an XML file ("full conformance" in W3C terms).
    Schemata must be constructed "manually" by instantiating an
    XML::Schema object and calling its various methods to define
    types, elements, and so on.  ("minimal conformance" in W3C terms).
    It is hoped that the modules will eventually implement sufficient
    conformance with the W3C XML Schema standard to allow the schema
    for W3C XML Schema documents to be encoded.  This will allow a 
    parser to be automatically generated which can read W3C XML Schema
    documents, validate them, and generate the approriate XML::Schema 
    Perl objects to represent it.  Thus, the minimally conformant
    parser should be able to bootstrap a fully conformant parser.
    </p>


    <p>
    Once you have a schema representation in terms of Perl objects,
    whether constructed manually or by an automatic code generator as
    described above, the <a href="#method_parser"><code><b>parser()</b></code></a> method can be
    called to generate a validating parser (an XML::Parser object) for
    parsing and validating XML instance documents according to the
    schema.
    </p>


    <p>
    In addition to "trivial" XML::Schema validation (we use the term
    lightly because such validation is anything but trivial), the
    XML::Schema module set implements a powerful extension mechanism
    by which the basic capability of the validating parser can be
    enhanced.  We introduce the term "XML Schedule" to describe this
    feature.  </p>


    <p> An XML Schedule is a set of production rules which can be
    associated with an XML Schema.  The rules specify what actions
    should be taken after the parser has identified, parsed and
    validated particular elements, attributes or character content
    within an instance document.  In implementation terms, the rules
    are simply Perl callbacks which annotate the schema and are called
    either immediately before or after a particular item
    is parsed.  </p>


    <p> By this process, we can create the appropriate annotations to
    a schema to perform additional validation or post-processing of
    certain part(s) of the instance document.  A schedule is effectively
    a "back-end" which sits behind the "front-end" parser.  The parser
    parses an XML document, validates each attribute, element, etc.,
    and then calls the schedule to perform any actions associated with
    that item.  You can use this technique to annotation the schema
    with your own XML processing actions that perform whatever
    manipulation of the incoming data that you require.  You can
    convert XML documents to different formats according to your own
    stylesheet rules or transformations, marshal XML data into Perl
    objects or database records, generate HTML pages, forms, and so
    on.
    </p>


    <p> One of the good things about all this is that it happens in
    "streaming" mode.  You don't have to build a big or complicated
    model in memory and then navigate it to find the bits that you
    want and throw away the rest.  Because you're parsing to a schema
    which indicates a "known" document structure, you can specify in
    advance what you want to do with different parts of it.
    </p>


    <p> As well as specifying what you want, you can also chose to
    selectively ignore certain parts of a document, effectively
    navigating only certain nodes of interest.  It should be possible,
    for example, to implement an XPath facility (or rather a subset of
    XPath) which annotes the nodes in the schema required to navigate
    to the specified XPath and ignores all others. 
    </p>


    <p>
    This is a stable alpha release of these modules. They are complete
    in as much as they do what they advertise they can do.  However,
    they are incomplete in places due to missing or inadequate
    documentation, tests, examples, etc.  Also be advised that the
    modules do not yet support some of the more obscure features
    described in the W3C XML Schema specification.
